Portions of the ceremony were also dedicated to the topics of environmental conservation and climate change.

The Games were officially opened by Acting President of Brazil Michel Temer.Directed by Fernando Meirelles, Daniela Thomas and Andrucha Waddington, the ceremony featured presentations of the history and culture of Brazil, including its landscape and forests, the history of the Brazilian people dating back to the arrival of the Portuguese, music and samba, and the favelas among other aspects. Portions of the ceremony were also dedicated to the topics of environmental conservation and climate change.
